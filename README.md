class_watcher_UCLA
==================

Checks the statuses of select UCLA classes and notifies you via texts when there are openings. Written in python.

To use create a text file with every line formated as follows (very important) with as many lines as you'd like:

[registrar address of class] [message to send when it opens(no spaces!!!)] [section numbers that you prefer with space between consecutive entries]

example:

http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/schedule/detselect.aspx?termsel=13F&subareasel=MATH&idxcrs=0115A+++ Math115A 262398271 262398281

note:it may not show up very well here, but take care to seperate the three sections of every line with a single space
